This repo contains a variety of projects centered around different artifical intelligence architectures and models.

CNN folder:

The majority of work and learning I have done into AI is centered around CNN's, which I have applied in a variety of different applciations:
  - such as througha  DCGAN (Music Gen project, separate repo)
  - in semantic segmentation using UNET model architecture
  - In my semester abroad studying at the Univserity of Liverpool, I studied a computer vision unit in which I learnt different training strategies on a pretrained RESNET model for classification on CIFAR100.

Transformers:

As a frequent user of Chat GPT and other pretrained transformer models, I was led to ponder how on earth do these things work. My aim in the transformer project was to follow the 'Attention is All You Need' paper to implement multi-head attention encoder/decoder network on a simple IMDB movie classification dataset.
